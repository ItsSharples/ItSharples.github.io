# In Confidence
Main Cohort Project

## Discussion
The game was made over one semester for the Commercial Games Development module with 5 other team members in collaboration with the entire Cohort!

We were each supplied with the Assets for our "IP", and were given the challenge of creating a Networked Multiplayer Game, that integrated each of the disparate Art Styles and Themes into one game.
