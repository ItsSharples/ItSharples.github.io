Quality Assurance was created in a one-week game jam run via my UWE Commercial Games Development course, working alongside an external company's AI 3D model generator, which utilises images to generate simple 3D objects from. This game took a spin on this approach where we sometimes managed to create real-looking objects, and sometimes not, utilising the AI generator, turning those outputs into a game! Quality Assurance was made by myself and 5 other fellow university Games Technology students.
