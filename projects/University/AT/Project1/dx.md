# DirectX - Skifree-ish

Why Flee when you can Ski?
Take a 'relaxing' ski down the infinite slopes, but be careful of the dangers that lie on those unassuming slopes.

### Experimentation
Bored of trees hurting your ride? Turn them into boosters inside the resource files and speed as fast as you want!

## Background

For the first AT Project, I was tasked with writing a small DirectX 11 game engine and a recreation of Skifree, an infinitely scrolling skiing game, where the player attempts to escape a Yeti.

For this project, I explored more of the customisation side, enabling the user to edit almost all of the game via it's XML files. This also allowed me to explore how to read and utilise text files to create the entire graphics pipeline (Even if it is within the XML Parser, TinyXML)
