## Discussion

Quality Assurance was made by myself and 5 other fellow university Games Technology students in a one-week game jam run inside the Commercial Games Development module.
Working alongside an external company's AI 3D model generator, which utilises images to generate simple 3D objects.
The game took the chaos of those outputs, as sometimes they were real-looking objects, and sometimes not, and turning that into a game, finding diamonds (well, mostly chairs) in the rough!
